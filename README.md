# 💬 Sentiment Analysis with VADER (ML Prototype)

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on YouTube comments using the **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** model — a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool designed for social media text.  

Currently implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**, this is the **prototype stage** of a future full-stack sentiment analysis app.

## 📓 Current Status

✅ **Notebook Phase**: Text-based sentiment analysis using VADER to classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral.

🔜 **Next Steps**:
- Turn the notebook into a REST API (Flask/FastAPI)
- Build an interactive frontend (React/Next.js)
- Full-stack deployment
